# Car_Black_Box

PIC18F4580 Microcontroller on rhydoLABZ Board.

Protocols Utilized: UART & I2C.
Peripherals Used: CLCD(hd44780), Matrix Keypad, RTC(ds1307) & EEPROM(24c02).

Black Boxes are typically used in any transportation system (ex: Airplanes) that are used for analysis post-crash and understand the root cause of accidents. Continuous monitoring and logging of events (ex: over-speeding) is critical for effective usage of black box. The goal of this project is to implement core functionalities of a car black-box in a PIC based micro-controller. Events will be logged in EEPROM in this project.
